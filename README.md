This is just the layout of the reward section, how I imagined it should look like. I adopted a mobile first approach in order to ensure responsiveness. I decided to focus more on the reward section itself other than the nav bars and side bar because those are already available on the balancee platform but I added a side bar in large screens to show exactly how the page would look like. My choice of color was based on the color scheme on the Balancee platform. I utilized next.js instead of normal react to use it's convenient routing feature.



## Tool utilized in the project
Next.js
Typescript
Tailwind Css

## The Card Feature
I got the idea for a feature that looks like a card from one of my wallet applications, I find the UI very pleasing to look at (even though there's nothing in it thoughðŸ˜ª) The Large text is the total amount available for withdrawal and the small text is the total cashback the user has earned, I created a JSON file with dummy data because I could not find an API that provides a fake transactions history.

## Future development
I intend to continually develop this project, I will add a feature that allows users to click on a transaction history and see the full details including description and have the option to file for a complaint in case of any transaction error but a debit was made. I will also add a booking and a settings page so they don't just s fill space but for now this project was made strictly for this role.

## Design
I decided to design based on the wallet app i have on my phone but also kept some originalities, I first drew how i want it to look like on paper before coding and as such I do not have a figma file, you will find that I only used the other apps as inspiration but this design is original as far as I'm concerned. I have experience working with figma files from front end websites like frontendmentor.io.
